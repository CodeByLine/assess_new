I'm trying to understand how to setup complex relationships in a Django app. Had to re-create this project multiple times.

This is a Django exercise on the mini blog challenge from Mozilla tutorial:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/django_assessment_blog

Initially attempted to use the CustomUser model from this site: 
https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model
https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-best-practices-referencing-user-model

But discovered this:
https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/blog/how-to-create-a-custom-django-user-model

And this:
